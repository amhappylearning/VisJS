    <p>Websites are hosted or stored on special computers called servers. When Internet users want to view your website, all they need to do is type your website address or domain into their browser. Their computer will then connect to your server and your
        web pages will be delivered to them through the browser. Most hosting companies require that you own your domain in order to host with them like www.harrypotter.com. You will need to purchase a domain name like this, but we can still host our
        website using another tool without a domain name. We will store our website on GitHub and then we will host our website pages from a GitHub repository. Watch this video for a better understanding. Steps to host a Website: 1. Ensure that your website’s
        starting page is named index.html. 2. Open https://github.com/ and sign up for GitHub. If you already have an account you can sign in to GitHub. 3. Click on New button and create a repository. 4. Then click on the Create repository button. 5.
        Click on “Uploading an existing file” and then choose your respective project file. ● Make sure your project files contain the main file with the name of “index.html”. 6. After selecting files click on the “Commit changes” button. 7. After uploading
        files successfully, to host your project, go to the settings option in the same repository. 8. Click the Settings button as shown below. 9. Scroll down and go to the “GitHub Pages” section. 10.Change Source option from “None” to “main”. Then press
        save Button 11.After completing the above step, you will see a link displayed in the “GitHub Pages” section. When you click on that, you will be redirected to your website’s home page. 12.This means your website is hosted now publicly. You can
        share the same link with others so they will also be able to see your website. Note: Sometimes after link generation, you have to wait for 3-5 mins to see your website. It may give an error of this kind, so please be patient. Reuploading Files
        To update your code for the website you can upload files again to the same repository and your website will be updated. The URL will not change. 1. Login to https://github.com/ 2. Then on the left hand side of the page you will find a list of
        the projects of yours. So open the project for which you want to update the files 3. Then for uploading files click on Add file option and select upload files option. 4. After selecting files click on the commit changes button. And then you can
        see your new files get updated in the existing repository. After you have re-uploaded any files, and when you are checking the output, do a HARD REFRESH OR open the website link in the Incognito tab. 13.If you need to keep an existing website
        as is, create a new repository and follow from</p> step 1. var first_name = "ABC"; var last_name = "XYZ"; console.log(first_name); console.log(last_name); var full_name = first_name.concat(last_name); console.log(full_name);


    <script>
        var first_name = "ABC";
        var last_name = "XYZ";

        console.log(first_name);

        console.log(last_name);

        var full_name = first_name.concat(last_name);
        console.log(full_name);
        var name2 = "ABCD";
        var lowercase = name2.toLowerCase();
        console.log(lowercase);
